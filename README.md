Galactic Merger Trees in D3
===============

##Team Members
- Laurel Orr ljorr1@cs.washington.edu
- Jennifer Ortiz:  jortiz16@cs.washington.edu

##Development Process:
We worked throughout the sections described below. We both built the initially queries necessary to construct the tree. Also, we both worked on the visualization layout as a whole. Specifically, this is what we each focused on and how we split the work:

* Laurel
  * Tree layout with time axis
  * Node/Edges annotations (color, size based on mass, reading node/edge information from pre-computed data files)
  * Defined tree similarity metric and added navigational slider with thumbnails
* Jennifer
  * Initial data gathering
  * Mass and Particle filter graphs/legends and added highlighting blur
  * Extra checkbox features and adding luminosity feature
